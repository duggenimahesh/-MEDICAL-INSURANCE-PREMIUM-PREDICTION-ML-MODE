# -MEDICAL-INSURANCE-PREMIUM-PREDICTION-ML-MODE
The goal of this project to give people an estimate of how much they need based on their individual health situation. After that, customers can work with any health insurance carrier and its plans and perks whilwe keeping the projected cost from our study in mind. This can assist a person in concentrating on the health side of an insurance.
This project aims to develop a Machine Learning model capable of predicting medical insurance premiums based on individual and lifestyle-related factors. With rising healthcare costs, accurately estimating insurance charges has become increasingly important for both providers and customers. By analyzing patterns in the dataset, this project helps identify the key variables influencing premium amounts and builds a reliable model to forecast them.

The dataset contains information such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking habits, number of children/dependents, and region of residence. These features are used to train multiple ML algorithms and compare their performance in predicting insurance costs.

ðŸ”¹ Workflow

Data Preprocessing â€“ Cleaning missing values, encoding categorical data, and applying feature scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Identifying correlations, visualizing feature distributions, and detecting outliers.

Model Training â€“ Implementing regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Model Evaluation â€“ Comparing performance using metrics like RÂ² Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Hyperparameter Tuning â€“ Optimizing models for improved accuracy and generalization.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

Python for implementation

Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

Scikit-learn & XGBoost for ML models

Jupyter Notebook for development and documentation

ðŸ”¹ Outcomes

Built a robust ML pipeline to predict insurance premiums.

Identified smoking status, BMI, and age as key drivers of premium variation.

Delivered accurate predictions with reduced error through ensemble learning.
